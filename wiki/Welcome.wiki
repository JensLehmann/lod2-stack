#summary Welcome page

= Welcome to the LOD2 Stack documentation wiki =

This wiki is divided into two parts:
 * user documentation covers pages which describe installation and usage issues of the whole stack as well on each individual package
 * developer documentation covers pages which describe how to add and integrate your own application to the stack
Here is a [http://code.google.com/p/lod2-stack/w/list complete list of all wiki pages].
